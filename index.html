				<b>Resume Joust Attack!</b> is a project I completed as a personal 48 hour hack-a-thon. Regular life also took place, so all actual code writing and research was done in less than 24 cumulative hours. In the days following completion, I have made small improvements, such as adding riders to the birds.<br><br>
				This game is based on the 1982 game <b><i><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=wiki+joust+game&l=1">Joust</a></i></b>. While the original was coded entirely in assembly, I opted for a more modern Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3. You can view the source on <i><a href="https://github.com/ConstableBrew/resume-joust-attack" target="_blank">my github</a></i>.
