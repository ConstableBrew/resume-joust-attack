<p>I’m a software developer with over 16 years of experience in both front end and back end development and database management. I have worked on many different applications on a wide variety of platforms, including Node.js, Backbone, ASP.NET, SQL Server, Postgres, MongoDB, and Access, and with a variety of languages including JavaScript, C#, and VB.</p>
<p>Most recently, I was a Full Stack / UI Software Engineer at SteelHouse, an ad tech company that specializes in retargeting. My team and I built our Facebook retargeting platform using a combination of ES6, CoffeeScript, JQuery, PHP Zend, CSS3 / LESS, HTML5, and Postgres.</p>
<p>Previously, I was a software developer with Hudl, a sports technology company that makes tools to help coaches. In this role I was focused on the athlete experience in a platform that was geared toward coaches. I implemented a redesign of the home page and athlete profile pages to have mobile-first responsive layouts using HTML5, CSS3 / SASS, and BackboneJS on the client side and C# MVC on the back end with MongoDB.</p>
<p>Some of my other experience includes building workflow improvement and automation tools using Access, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML5.</p>
<p>Colleagues know me as a highly creative problem solver who works hard to get things done. I am often eager to hit the ground running, as I tend to find the best questions to ask about the business and the users once I have put in some time thinking about the possible solutions. I work well alone, but I’m at my best when collaborating with others.</p>
