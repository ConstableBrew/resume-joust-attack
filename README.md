# resume-joust-attack
HTML5 Canvas demo game

Resume Joust Attack! is a project I completed as a personal 48 hour hack-a-thon. Regular life also took place, so all actual code writing and research was done in less than 24 cumulative hours. In the days following completion, I have made small improvements, such as adding riders to the birds.

This game is based on the 1982 game Joust. While the original was coded entirely in assembly, I opted for a more modern Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3. You can view the source on my github.
